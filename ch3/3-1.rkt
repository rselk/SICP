;; Exercise 3.1.  An accumulator is a procedure that is called repeatedly with a
;; single numeric argument and accumulates its arguments into a sum. Each time
;; it is called, it returns the currently accumulated sum. Write a procedure
;; make-accumulator that generates accumulators, each maintaining an independent
;; sum. The input to make-accumulator should specify the initial value of the
;; sum

(define (make-accumulator x)
  (lambda (y)
    (set! x (+ y x))x))

(define A (make-accumulator 5))
(A 10)
